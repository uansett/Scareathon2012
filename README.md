Entry to a digital graphics competition held by Digital Shoreditch 27th of October 2012.
========================================================================================

The entry consisted of cups concealed by a cover which all contained nasty things to touch - and these were connected to trigger keypresses when touched. By touching these triggers the contestant could modify a web cam imagery of themselves which was full of surprises - goofy sounds and horrible creatures. The project uses highly unreliable code that was compiled together in the few hours available during the competition and is based on chromes support for webcam in HTML and Javascript. Support for other browsers is not and will probably not be implemented.
